# Superstore Sales Analysis (Python + Power BI)
This is a simple end-to-end data analysis project I built to understand how real analytics work.  
I used Python for cleaning and exploring the data, and Power BI for creating a dashboard.

Overview:
The goal of this project was to look at Superstore sales and understand which categories, regions, and months perform the best.  
I also created visuals to see trends and profit patterns.

What I Found:
- Technology is the highest-selling category  
- The West region performs really well in terms of revenue  
- Some products bring in sales but also create losses  
- Sales increase a lot during the end of the year  

Python Work:
In the Jupyter Notebook, I worked on
- Cleaning the dataset  
- Creating month and year columns  
- Category-wise analysis  
- Region-wise analysis  
- Line charts, bar charts, and heatmaps

Power BI Dashboard:
I built a dashboard that shows
- Total Sales  
- Total Profit  
- Sales by Category  
- Monthly Sales Trend by Year

Cleaned Dataset:
I exported the cleaned dataset from Python so it can be used in Power BI.

File: `superstore_cleaned.csv`
Tools Used:
- Python  
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Power BI  

Why I Made This:
I’m trying to build my data analytics skills and create projects that show what I can do.  
This project helped me understand how data moves from Python → cleaning → analysis → dashboard.
